\alias{suggest.trials.noxy}

\title{Returns suggested trials for a factorial design}

\description{Suggested trials are returned as a list with one object, a numeric matrix with the last column indicating with 1 the suggested trial}

\usage{
suggest.trials.noxy(dataset, rawModel, additionalInfo)
}

\arguments{
  \item{dataset}{ Data for prediction. A list of two objects: datasetURI (a character string ), dataEntry (a data frame).}
  \item{rawModel}{ R model serialized (suggested trials for the data matrix supplied in exp.design.funct1). 
}
  \item{additionalInfo}{ Any additional information needed for rawModel. Here the list generated by exp.design.funct.noxy. The list should contain a field named 'predictedFeatures' which should be exactly the same as that returned by exp.design.funct.noxy function. 
}
}

\details{ No further details required }

\value{A list of one objected called 'predictions' which is also a list of one cell data-frames each containing the suggested trials for the data tested. This object is a matrix for the suggested trials per variable and level; the last column indicates with 1 the suggested trial
